## Features

- enter a string of text (any language or emoji up to 10 chars) to display a colorful list of all permutations
- switch between Combinations and Permutations mode to see how the formula and permutation list changes
- change the 'r' value to see any possible nCr or nPr
- toggle subscript markers for duplicate graphemes
- detect user preference for dark mode and allow user to set their preference independently
- Try: 'ä½ å€‘å¥½', 'test', '+-=+', 'â™¡â™ â™¦â™£', 'ðŸª»ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ»'
- click the sun/moon icon to switch on dark mode

## Lessons Learned

- Enabling dark mode on the body element which is above the root element requires additional code
- Switching between design tasks and thinking tasks is a great way to maintain momentum
- SVG elements have more flexibility when imported as React components

## Limitations/Future Enhancements

- Allow users to set a dark mode preference or default to system
- Allow more than 1000 permutations to be shown
- Allow more than 10 characters for input
